# Welcome at this file

I have a Vera Edge at home, which works marvelously for the task given. I want to power up my coffee-machine and turn off the heating when leaving the house.

To make sure that everything is powered down, I used Locative (https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/locative/id725198453) at iOS. This works for a while, but after some months, Apple claims that it is time to kill the app for not using it (it is working in the background), and then the plan falls apart.

## Solution

Hence, the solution is to get even more in the Apple Ecosystem. Homekit is able to connect to Vera Edge. The Dockerfile, Config.json are a working solution to get Homekit working at my home.

## Help

If you need any help, please let me know!
Cheers!
